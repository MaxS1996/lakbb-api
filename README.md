# Notdienst Finder

* small Python library that is supposed to help you searching for the nearest emergency pharmacy in Germany
* currently only supports two states:
  * Berlin
  * Brandenburg
* each state has a least one chamber that is in charge of setting the schedule of emergency pharmacies, so no unified API can be used
* so for each state a backend needs to be implemented
